As for the question itself - you can export your Anaconda environment using:

conda env export > environment.yml
And recreate it using:

conda env create -f environment.yml
Please note that as others suggested - you should use virtual environments which allows you to create a certain environment that is separated from that of your machine and manage it more easily.

To create a virtual environment in Anaconda you can use:

conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda
which you activate using:

source activate yourenvname
